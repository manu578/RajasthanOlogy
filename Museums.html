          <p class="lead">The foundation of Albert Hall was laid during the visit of the Prince of Wales, Albert Edward to Jaipur in 1876. It was not sure how the building would be used. On the suggestion of Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II in 1880, a
            temporary museum was built in 1881 to display the products of local craftsmen. The Albert Hall was completed in 1887 by the architect, Samuel Swinton Jacob, Director of Jaipur PWD. The temporary museum, whose artefacts were collected from
            several parts of India and its neighbours were shifted in the new museum.

            The building became a fine example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. The corridors were decorated with murals in a variety of styles and European, Egyptian, Chinese, Greek and Babylonian civilizations were portrayed to enable the visitors
            to develop their knowledge of art and history.

          <p class="lead">Ahar Archaeological Museum is known for its various architectural features and sculptures pieces date back to 1700 BC. A historic tenth-century metal figure of Buddha is a special attraction in the museum. There are rare
            pieces of earthen pots which are of historical importance. Located at 3 km distance from Udaipur city, around Ahar museum there are about nineteen cenotaphs of Maharanas, where they were cremated. Among all of them, the cenotaph of
            Maharana Amar Singh, who reigned from 1597 to 1620 is more attractive.

            Though there are not so much to see ion the museum but the collection of the museum is very rare of which some dates back to centuries old and before that. Amongst the assortment of sculptures, a statue of Vishnu-Nag-Nathan is also worth
            mentioning.</p>

          <p class="lead">Taragarh Fort in Ajmer was built in 1354 A.D. It was built under the reign of King Ajaypal Chauhan in the year 1354. The location of the fort is quite remarkable as you discover that it is located on a steep hillside.
            Taragarh Ajmer has three main gateways that allow entrance to its inside. These gateways are known as Lakshmi Pol, Phuta Darwaza, and Gagudi ki Phatak. Although this fort was a spectacular work of architecture, these gates are now in
            ruins. Taragarh Fort was also quite famous in those days for its spectacular tunnels that crisscross through the hillside. It is a famous tourist spot and remains a stunning example of the impressive Rajasthani architecture. The Taragarh
            Fort was used as a crucial military center during the rule of Mughals in India. But after a few years, when the town of Ajmer was annexed by the British, the fort was converted and used as a sanatorium.</p>
