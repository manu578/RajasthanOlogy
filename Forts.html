            Raja Man Singh. This fort is also very popularly known as the Amer Palace. The Amer Fort was built in red sandstone and marble and the Maotha Lake adds a certain charm to the entire Fort. Though the fort is quite old and may even look so
            from the outside, it is beautiful on the inside and boasts of various buildings of prominence like the 'Diwan-i-Aam', the 'Sheesh Mahal' and even the 'Sukh Mahal'. The Amer Fort has influences of both Hindu and Muslim architecture. This
            fort also has the 'Shila Devi' Temple and the 'Ganesh Pol' which is a gate that leads to the private palaces of the kings. The Amer Fort has many pavilions and halls of great interest and other popular attractions.

            The mighty powerful fort of Ranthambore has seen an immense number of attacks and conquests. The fort was the major barrier for the invaders because of the difficulty they faced to capture and the well-planned construction of the fort.
            The Ranthambore Fort is situated inside the Ranthambore National Park which was the hunting grounds for the Maharajas of the Jaipur dynasty. It is located in the town of Sawai Madhopur in Jaipur. It had been built in the mid 10th century,
            according to the Government of Rajasthan's Amber Development & Management Authority, during the rule of Sapaldaksha.

          <p class="lead">Jaisalmer Fort is situated in the city of Jaisalmer, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is believed to be one of the very few "living forts" in the world (such as Carcassonne, France), as nearly one fourth of the old
            city's population still resides within the fort.For the better part of its 860-year history, the fort was the city of Jaisalmer. The first settlements outside the fort walls, to accommodate the growing population of Jaisalmer, are said to
            have come up in the 17th century.

            Jaisalmer Fort is the second oldest fort in Rajasthan, built in 1156 AD by the Rajput Rawal (ruler) Jaisal from whom it derives its name, and stood at the crossroads of important trade routes (including the ancient Silk road).

            The fort's massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny lion colour during the day, fading to honey-gold as the sun sets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert. </p>

          <p class="lead">Taragarh Fort in Ajmer was built in 1354 A.D. It was built under the reign of King Ajaypal Chauhan in the year 1354. The location of the fort is quite remarkable as you discover that it is located on a steep hillside.
            Taragarh Ajmer has three main gateways that allow entrance to its inside. These gateways are known as Lakshmi Pol, Phuta Darwaza, and Gagudi ki Phatak. Although this fort was a spectacular work of architecture, these gates are now in
            ruins. Taragarh Fort was also quite famous in those days for its spectacular tunnels that crisscross through the hillside. It is a famous tourist spot and remains a stunning example of the impressive Rajasthani architecture. The Taragarh
            Fort was used as a crucial military center during the rule of Mughals in India. But after a few years, when the town of Ajmer was annexed by the British, the fort was converted and used as a sanatorium.</p>
